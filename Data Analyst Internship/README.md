### Executive Summary
**************
<table>
<tr><td>Integrated Planning Section at MTC uses and maintains an extensive variety of data that is used to support growing number of projects and initiatives. Currently the data is spread between several databases, shared drives, box and personal drives in many different formats.  “By 2020 IDC” [International Data Corporation] “predicts the amount of digital information will grow by a factor of 30, the number of files, by a factor of 60”. MTS’s N-drive alone is holding more than half a million files and folders containing more the 60,000 datasets. Furthermore, “IDC surveys find that the time spent searching for information averages 8.8 hours per week.” The integrated planning section typically invest significant amount of time searching for data relevant to a particular project, initiative or task, as well as hire outside consultants to provide that data. The goal of this Analytical Services Internship was to work with staff to develop a strategy for data discovery within the planning groups of the Air District, MTC and its transitional employees. The solution design is not to drastically change how things are done, but rather to improve and streamline the process with clear understanding of rules when it comes to data methodology to eliminate time, effort and cost spend on finding relevant data and greatly enhance the efficiency of the unit.</td></tr></table>
