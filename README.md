## Bay Area Spatial Information System (B.A.S.I.S)

Bay Area Spatial Information System (B.A.S.I.S) will bring key datasets onto an industry standard open-data platform where users internal and external to MTC/ABAG can download it, or access it via API for analysis and modeling.  

B.A.S.I.S will collect datasets typically sourced from local cities and counties such as Land Use, Zoning, Residential Permitting, and a host of related datasets that describe the development pipeline activity for Bay Area Jurisdictions, all of which is directly related to Plan Bay Area.  

Typical datasets that will be targeted for collecing include parcel and policy data used by UrbanSim for land use modeling, as well as housing data such as residential permits, and housing policies. Over time B.A.S.I.S will steadily add more datasets relevant to Regional Transportation and Land Use Planning for the San Francisco Bay Area Region. 

B.A.S.I.S will collect invaluable feedback from key stakeholders and regional partners through a Working Group.

B.A.S.I.S will present the data for review by local jurisdictions in an inventory format that allows local jurisdictions to select a location and retrieve a summary inventory of the data available at that location.  The summary will be associated with a count of parcels that contain any one or more of the landuse, transportation or development characteristics that we track as part of Housing Development Tracking, Transportation and Land Use Modeling (UrbanSim).

Finally, B.A.S.I.S will act as the skeletal and nervous system of the IRPP Database Framework.  The DataViz team will conform all data collected and used for policy development and analytical purposes throughout the IRPP and the other Policy and Operation units of ABAG/MTC and BATA.
