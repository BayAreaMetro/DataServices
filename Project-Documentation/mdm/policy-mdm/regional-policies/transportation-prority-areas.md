## Data Sources

## Analysis Parameters

A “Transit priority area” is defined in [Californaia Public Resource Code, Section 21099](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PRC&sectionNum[…]=true&keyword=transit%20priority%20area+major%20transit):

an area within one-half mile of a major transit stop that is existing or planned, if the planned stop is scheduled to be completed within the planning horizon included in a Transportation Improvement Program or applicable regional transportation plan."

## Methodology
The data set was developed using several data sources that include Planned Transit Stops identified in the Plan Bay Area 2050 Regional Transportation Plan, Existing Transit locations extracted from the 511 GTFS Regional Transit Database, and manual editing by the Plan Bay Area team.
