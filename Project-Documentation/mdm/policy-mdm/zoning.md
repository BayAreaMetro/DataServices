# Zoning Lookup 2020

## Description  
The Zoning 2020 dataset includes the unique recid, city_name, existing land use code (exlu_code), existing land use description (exlu_description), existing land use overlay (exlu_area_overlay), regional land use classification (regional_lu_class), minimum floor area ratio (min_far), maximum floor area ratio (max_far), minimum residential density (min_res), maximum residential density (max_res), editor name, edit_date, county_name, existing land use HEX color code (exlu_code_color).

## Purpose and Use   
Used in MTC Land Use Modeling, Housing Policy and Long Range Planning Research. 

## Data Collection  
This dataset was compiled using juridiction input (via the BASIS Jurisdiction Review module) from Fall 2019, spatial zoning data, and manual ordinance-based updates.

## Data Processing   
Manual data updates were saved as tables (.csv or .xlsx) or added via the BASIS Jurisdiction Review module to Socrata tables. These inputs were combined and processed to create a zoning table with a unique recid for each jurisdiction's zone code for all jurisdictions in the 9-county Bay Area.
