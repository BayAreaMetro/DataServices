# Regional Parcel Characteristics

### Description, Purpose, and Use
This documentation provides a high-level overview of the Regional Parcel Database's wide variety of fields. These fields describe characteristics of the region's parcels including -- but not limited to -- land use, building characteristics, and monetary value. These characteristics are used in MTC/ABAG land use modeling, housing policy, and long range planning research. The database has significant overlap with the UrbanSim Building and Parcels Datasets that are used for Plan Bay Area 2050's UrbanSim models.
