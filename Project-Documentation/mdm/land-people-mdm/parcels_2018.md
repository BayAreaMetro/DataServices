# Parcels

## Description
The parcel/building data includes the unique parcel identifier (APN) as well as attributes about the parcel (county, land value, if the parcel canâ€™t be developed) and buildings (year assessed, square feet, number of stories, if the building is historic). 

## Purpose and Use  
Used in MTC Land Use Modeling, Housing Policy and Long Range Planning Research.  More information about how this dataset is used can be found in the [Basemap section of the UrbanSim documentation](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/petrale/blob/master/basemap/basemap_process.md).  

## Data Collection
This data was compiled using local information collected from each of the 109 jurisdictions in the San Francisco Bay Area Region.  {Discuss Data Collection Effort Here}

## Data Processing
This data is generated using a combination of sources and methods mainly attributed to data collected from local assessor's office parcel characteristics. Each county assessor's dataset is processed individually. The figure below provides a high level overview of the data processing steps.
