# UrbanSim Buildings  

## Description  
The UrbanSim Buildings dataset includes the unique joinid, the county assessor's parcel number (APN), as well as attributes about the parcel (county, land value, if the parcel canâ€™t be developed) and buildings (year assessed, square feet, number of stories, if the building is historic). Includes Historic and Commercial Bldgs. (basis)

## Purpose and Use   
Used in MTC Land Use Modeling, Housing Policy and Long Range Planning Research. More information about how this dataset is used can be found in the [Basemap section of the UrbanSim documentation](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/petrale/blob/master/basemap/basemap_process.md).

## Data Collection  
This dataset was compiled using parcel characteristics data from each county's Assessor's Office.

## Data Processing   
This data is generated using a combination of sources and methods (Python, SQL, etc). Each county assessor's dataset is processed individually. The figure below provides a high level overview of the data processing steps.
