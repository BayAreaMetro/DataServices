The DataViz team coordinated closely Bay Area CMAs to collect major residential and commercial development projects for all cities within the jurisdiction of the following agencies:

* Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
* Sonoma County Transportation Authority

## Data Processing
This data is generated using a combination of sources and methods, mainly leveraging python jupyter notebooks as well as some manual review and type coding work using CSVs. The figure below provides a high level overview of the data processing steps.
