### Bay Area Spatial Information System Master Data Management (MDM)
Master Data Management (MDM) is a method used to define and manage the critical data of an organization to provide, with data integration, a single point of reference. The data that is mastered may include reference data- the set of permissible values, and the analytical data that supports decision making. Through the BASIS iniative, MTC has begun the early work of building a regional data repository that is both well sourced, documented and accessible to internal staff and external stakeholders alike.  

The MDM list and associated documentation covering data processing steps, attribute definitions, and relationships with other key datasets can be found [here](/mdm/readme.md).
