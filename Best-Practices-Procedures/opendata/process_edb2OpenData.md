## Promoting Content from Enterprise Database to the Metropolitan Transportation Commission's Open Data Site
The process to get data included in the enterprise database meets the majority of the requirements for posting resources to the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Open Data site. There are some additional requirements, and they are as follows:
 - Only data developed/created by staff and used to produce a final/adopted document, plan, or policy released/implemented by the Commission are acceptable for promotion from the enterprise database to the open data site.
 
 - The enterprise database manager, acting as the open data manager, will work with the data creator to determine which license to apply to the data and add it to the metadata information along with the agency disclaimer. 

 - Furthermore, the open data manager will work with the data creator to determine how the data will be made available to the public (download only, generic feature service, symbolized feature set, web map, multiple subsets, etcetera). One thing to note, the more formats the data is requested to be made available, the longer it will take to make the data available on the open data site.

 - Data obtained from a third-party that is included in the enterprise database in an unmodified form will not be distributed as a public resource by the MTC, even if the data itself is public.

   That said, there can be an exception to the prohibition on making unmodified, third-party data available as a public resource provided by MTC. The exception regards third-party data that is used to produce a final/adopted document, plan, or policy released/implemented by the MTC. Additional requirements for publishing third-party data as a public resource are:
    - The metadata must prominantly state that the data may not necessarily be the most current version available from the third-party that produced the data.
  
    - The metadata must identify the final/adopted document, plan, or policy the data was used to produce.
  
    - The metadata must include a link to the original data download source, provide contact information for the data provider so the public can obtain their own copy of the data, or both.
  
    - The data itself will not be made available for download. It will only be made available as a feature service or web map that matches how it was used, or displayed, in the original MTC product.
