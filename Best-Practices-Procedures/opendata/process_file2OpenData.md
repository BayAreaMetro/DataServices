- Review if data is eligible for posting

- Create metadata for resource. Metadata requirements can be found [HERE](requirements_openDataMetadata.md).

- Move resource and metadata to review directory at J:\SECTION\PLANNING\OpenDataReview. If there are multiple files, either ensure the file names have consistent naming so they are naturally grouped or ZIP them in a single, compressed file

- Notify open data manager by sending them an e-mail at msmith@bayareametro.gov to let them know a resource is ready for review

-	The open data manager, will work with the data creator to determine which license to apply to data and add it to metadata information along with agency disclaimer.

-	The open data manager, will work with data creator to determine how data will be made available to public (download only, generic feature service, symbolized feature set, web map, multiple subsets, etcetera).

- The open data manager will post the resource to the open data site
